1. Information We Collect
1.1 Photos, Videos, and Media Access

The App requires access to your photo library and video files to perform cleaning and classification functions (such as detecting similar, duplicate, or blurry photos, and organizing media).

All photo and video analysis is performed locally on your device. Your media files are never uploaded to any external server.

The App may request access to your contacts to identify and clean duplicate or invalid contact entries.

Contact data is analyzed locally on your device and is not transmitted or stored externally.

Access to your calendar may be requested to identify and clean expired or duplicate calendar events.

Calendar data remains entirely on your device.

We may collect anonymous diagnostic data (e.g., app crashes, performance metrics, subscription status) to improve stability and performance.

Such data may be collected via Apple‚Äôs App Analytics or other privacy-compliant third-party tools, and contains no personal or media content.

3. AI and Machine Learning Processing

    <h1>AI Cleaner Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the mobile application <strong>AI Cleaner</strong> (the "App" or "Service"), operated by Shengcheng Yang (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding the data we handle.</p>

    <p>By using the AI Cleaner App, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Our Core Privacy Principle: Local-Only Processing</h2>

    <p><strong>AI Cleaner</strong> is an intelligent cleaning and organizing tool designed for your iPhone. All core cleaning, organization, analysis, and data management features are executed <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</p>

    <div class="commitment">
        <h3>We adhere to the following strict principles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Uploading:</strong> We do not upload your personal data—including your photos, videos, contacts, or calendar events—to any of our servers or any third-party cloud service for analysis, processing, or storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Access Only:</strong> The App temporarily accesses your device’s photo library, contacts, and calendar <strong>only</strong> to perform the specific tasks you initiate (e.g., identifying duplicates, categorization, merging contacts).</li>
            <li><strong>No Sharing:</strong> We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal content with any third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You retain full control over your content at all times.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>Because the App’s primary functionality is local, the amount of information we collect is minimal and limited to non-sensitive operational and customer support data.</p>

    <h3>2.1. User-Provided Information (Direct Interactions)</h3>
    <p>We collect information that you directly provide to us when you communicate with us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Correspondence Information:</strong> If you contact us via our support email <strong>hookupdating@outlook.com</strong> with inquiries, feedback, or support requests, we will collect your email address, the content of your message, and any attachments you send.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Automatically Collected Technical Data</h3>
    <p>When you access and use the App, we automatically collect certain technical and usage information to ensure the App runs smoothly, is error-free, and to help us improve the service. This data is generally anonymized or aggregated and does <strong>not</strong> include your personal content (photos, videos, contacts, etc.).</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Category</th>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>We use the minimal information we collect solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To operate the App's functions, including processing your subscriptions and delivering the cleaning and organization features you initiate.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide Customer Support:</strong> To respond to your inquiries, troubleshoot problems, and resolve technical issues you may experience.</li>
        <li><strong>To Monitor and Improve Performance:</strong> To analyze crash logs, understand usage trends, and continually improve the speed, quality, and effectiveness of the AI Cleaner application.</li>
        <li><strong>To Process Subscriptions:</strong> To manage your App Store subscriptions and provide you with relevant service messages regarding your paid access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How Your Local Data is Handled (AI Cleaner Features)</h2>
    <p>This section explains how your most sensitive data is used <em>locally</em> by the App to execute the advertised features:</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Feature/Data Type</th>
                <th>Local Access & Processing Detail</th>
                <th>Commitment</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Photo/Video Library</strong></td>
                <td>Accessed only when you explicitly open and initiate a feature (e.g., Deep Clean, Categorization). Our AI engine runs on your device to identify duplicates, similar photos, screenshots, and classify content (People, Scenery, etc.).</td>
                <td><strong>No Photos or Videos are ever transmitted off your device.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Video Compression</strong></td>
                <td>Processing occurs locally to rewrite the video file in a smaller format on your device.</td>
                <td><strong>The video is compressed locally; it is never uploaded to a server.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Contacts Manager</strong></td>
                <td>Accessed only when you open the Contact Manager feature to scan for duplicates, incomplete entries, or perform a backup.</td>
                <td><strong>Your Contact data is used exclusively for local cleanup and backup. It is not shared.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Calendar Tidy-up</strong></td>
                <td>Accessed only to identify and remove old/expired events when you run this specific function.</td>
                <td><strong>Calendar data is processed locally and is not shared.</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Private Album</strong></td>
                <td>Photos/videos placed in this album are encrypted and stored locally within the App’s protected space on your device.</td>
                <td><strong>The data remains locked on your device and is not accessible to us or third parties.</strong></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>5. Disclosure and Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data that identifies you personally (such as your photos, contact lists, or calendar events) with outside parties. We only share the minimal technical and aggregated data described in Section 2.2 with the following categories of service providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> We use third-party analytics services (such as Firebase or others) to track non-identifying technical usage data (e.g., crash reports, feature usage frequency) to help us understand and improve the App. This data is collected in a way that does not personally identify you.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or ensure the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> We implement and maintain reasonable and industry-standard physical, technical, and administrative security measures to protect the limited technical data we do collect against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain automatically collected technical data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, usually for the period during which you use the App and a reasonable time thereafter for analysis and record-keeping purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Service Providers (Third-Party Access to Technical Data)</h2>
    <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), such as for hosting, crash reporting, and analytics. These Service Providers have access to your limited technical data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Privacy Rights (GDPR & US State-Specific Rights)</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights concerning the personal data we hold about you (primarily your correspondence and technical data):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>The Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>The Right to Erasure/Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete your personal data from our records.</li>
        <li><strong>The Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>The Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>The Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since we <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or share your sensitive personal content (photos, videos, contacts, calendar), and the limited technical data we do collect is often anonymized, exercising these rights will typically pertain to your support correspondence data.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
